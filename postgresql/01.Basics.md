###### custom data types
```postgresql
CREATE TYPE sex AS ENUM ('M','F');
INSERT INTO person (name, sex) VALUES ('chaitanya', 'M');
```
can be seen in the Types folder of the schema
we can have a computed data type where the value of the column is calculated with a formula 
```postgresql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  full_name VARCHAR(101) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (first_name || ' ' || last_name) STORED
);
```
**`||` is used to concat the values**
```postgresql
CREATE TYPE phone_number AS (
    country_code VARCHAR(5),
    area_code VARCHAR(5),
    number VARCHAR(15)
);

CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    phone phone_number
);

INSERT INTO contacts (name, phone) VALUES 
('John Doe', ROW('+1', '800', '5551234')),
('Jane Smith', ROW('+44', '20', '79460000'));

SELECT 
    name, 
    phone.country_code, 
    phone.area_code, 
    phone.number 
FROM contacts;
```
###### Date/Time
1. Date - No matter the format you enter it will be translated to, yyyy-mm-dd
2. Time - 
	1. if we enter like '1:30:30 PM' :: without time zone -> 13:30:30
	2. '01:30 AM EST' -> 01:30-5:00 (UTC format)
3. Timestamp - 
	1. time with date
4. Interval -
	2. '1 day' ->01:00
	3. '1 D 1H 1 M 1 S' -> 01:01:01:01
	4. we can add and subtract intervals

## Basic SQL
##### To list all the databases
```postgresql
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```
##### To Create a database
```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE test;
```
##### To Delete database
```postgresql
DROP DATABASE test;
```
##### To create a Table
```postgresql
CREATE TABLE person (
	id INT,
	name VARCHAR(100),
	city VARCHAR(100)
);
```
##### Inserting into table
```postgresql
INSERT INTO 
	person(id, name, city)
VALUES 
	(101, 'RAJU', 'DELHI')
	, (102, 'RAJU', 'DELHI')
	, (103, 'RAJU', 'DELHI');
```
the full path for a table is 
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM database_name.schema_name.table_name;
```
##### Update based on condition
```postgresql
UPDATE
	person
SET
	city = 'NEW DELHI',
	name = 'raju'
WHERE
	name = 'RAJU'
```
##### Delete based on conditions
```postgresql
DELETE FROM
	person
WHERE
	id = 104;
```
##### delete row and drop table / type
```postgresql
DELETE FROM customer
WHERE id=1;

DROP TABLE customer;

DROP TYPE sex;
```
##### Constraints
```postgresql
CREATE TABLE users(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	date_joined DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
###### foreign key
```postgreSQL
CREATE TABLE addresses (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	address VARCHAR (475) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'home',
	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

ALTER TABLE 
	addresses 
ADD CONSTRAINT 
	fk_user 
FOREIGN KEY 
	(user_id) 
REFERENCES 
	users(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;
```
inserting foreign key into address table
```sql
INSERT INTO addresses (user_id,address)
VALUES (1,'some addresss');
```
##### Selecting
Selecting Where
```postgresql
select * from person where id=101 or name='RAJU';
select * from person where id=101 and name='RAJU';
```
###### Operators to be used with the where clause
- **Equal**: `=`
- **Less than**: `<`
- **Greater than**: `>`
- **Less than or Equal**: `<=`
- **Greater than or Equal**: `>=`
- **Not Equal**: `<>` or `!=`
- **In (a,b,c)**
###### logical operators 
- **AND**
- **OR**
- **NOT**
###### order by 
```postgresql
SELECT lastname, firstname FROM teachers ORDER BY lastname ASC, firstname DESC;
```
###### Distinct
```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;
```
the distinct keyword is distinct over all the values being selected not just one
this helps us write queries for questions like for each district who are all the candidates up for election
```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT district, candidate FROM election_registrations;
```
this will return the distinct pair of district and candidates
###### limiting
limiting the number of rows in the output
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM sales_item 
WHERE discount > .15
ORDER BY discount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
top 3rd salary
```postgresql
SELECT salary FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
top 3rd salary in case of duplicates
```postgresql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```
###### Like clause
to match regex or a* use `a%`
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM person where name like 'a%'
```
###### string manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name), LENGTH(first_name) AS name
FROM sales_person;
SELECT 'Hello, ' || 'World!' AS greeting; -- use concat function if the strings can be null
SELECT RTRIM('Hello World   ');

SELECT LTRIM('   Hello World');

SELECT TRIM('   Hello World   ');

-- You can also specify the characters to be removed
SELECT RTRIM('Hello Worldxxx', 'x');
SELECT LTRIM('xxxHello World', 'x');
SELECT TRIM('xHello Worldx', 'x');

-- Extracts the first 5 characters from the left of the string
SELECT LEFT('Hello World', 5);
-- Extracts the last 5 characters from the right of the string
SELECT RIGHT('Hello World', 5);
-- we can also perform slicing in postgresql
SELECT 'Hello World'[2:4];
SELECT 'Hello World'[2:LENGTH('Hello World')];

SELECT REVERSE('Hello World');

SELECT POSITION('World' IN 'Hello World'); -- indexof
-- Convert to upper case
SELECT UPPER('Hello World');

-- Convert to lower case
SELECT LOWER('Hello World');
SELECT REPLACE('Hello World', 'World', 'Everyone');

-- CTE
WITH string_var AS (
    SELECT 'Hello World' AS my_string
)
SELECT my_string[2:LENGTH(my_string)] FROM string_var;

```
###### Handling nulls
1. `coalesce()`, takes in any number of input, returns the first non null as output
```postgresql
Select first_name || coalesce(' ' || middle_name || ' ', '') || last_name from person;
```
We can check if the value is null or not with
```postgresql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```
###### date manipulation functions
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) from customer;
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM birth_date) FROM customer;
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM birth_date) FROM customer;
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM created_at) FROM orders;
```
###### Aggregate functions
```postgresql
SELECT COUNT(id) FROM person;
SELECT SUM(salary) from person;
SELECT AVG(salary) from person;
SELECT MIN(salary) from person;
SELECT MAX(salary) from person;
```
###### Casting data types
```postgresql
SELECT 1 + CAST('1' AS INTEGER);

SELECT numeric_column, CAST(numeric_column AS integer), CAST(numeric_column AS varchar(6)) from table number;
```
or
```postgresql
SELECT 1 + '1'::INTEGER;

SELECT 1::TEXT || '1';
```

###### mathematics
```postgresql
SELECT
    1 + 1 AS ADDITION,
    10.0 / 3 AS DIVISION,
    10 / 3 AS "Integer Division",
    10/3.0 AS "Decimal Division",
    10 % 3 AS MODULO;
```
###### Group by
used with aggregate functions over the groups, sum, count, avg etc round() min(), max()
```postgresql
SELECT product_id, SUM(price) 
FROM item 
GROUP BY product_id ;
```
filtering the groups
```postgresql
SELECT product_id, SUM(price) 
FROM item 
WHERE product_id = 1 
GROUP BY product_id ;
```
***the WHERE clause must be before group by clause***
this where clause works because we are not filter on the basis of any aggregation like sum or count
if we wanted to filter on the basis of some aggregation we would have to use Having clause
***the HAVING clause is used after the group by***
***the ORDER BY clause can be after the group by***
```postgresql
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date)
HAVING EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12;

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) AS Month, COUNT(id) 
FROM sales_person 
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) <> 12
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date);
```
These two queries are equivalent since the filter is not based on any aggregation like salary per group
if that were the case use the Having clause because the where filter clause will be calculated before grouping by
###### SubQueries
select all employees receiving the minimum salary
```postgresql
SELECT 
	* 
FROM
	employees
WHERE
	salary=(
		SELECT 
			min(salary)
		FROM
			employees
	);
```
###### Correlated subqueries
```postgresql
SELECT customers.customer_name  
FROM customers  
WHERE EXISTS (  
  SELECT order_id  
  FROM orders  
  WHERE customer_id = customers.customer_id  
);
```
we can also use any or all instead of exists
any checks for any, and all passes only when all the records in the subquery match
```postgresql
SELECT product_name  
FROM products  
WHERE product_id = ALL (  
  SELECT product_id  
  FROM order_details  
  WHERE quantity > 10  
);
```
###### logical cases
```postgresql
SELECT 
    something,
    CASE 
        WHEN 
	        t.x < 5 
	    THEN 
		    'No'
        WHEN 
	        t.x < 10 
	        AND
	        t.y > 5
	    THEN 
		    'Maybe'
        ELSE 
	        'Yes'
    END AS columnName
FROM triangle AS t
```
##### Joins
###### Inner
```postgresql
SELECT 
	H.SalesOrderID
	, H.OrderDate
	, H.TotalDue
	, D.SalesOrderDetailID
	, D.ProductID
	, D.OrderQty 
FROM 
	Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS H 
	INNER JOIN 
	Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
	ON H.SalesOrderID=D.SalesOrderID;
```
if a single column can not uniquely identify the row, in case of composite keys, we have to use multiple columns in the join condition, lest we get a cartesian product
```postgresql
SELECT 
	D.SalesOrderID, 
	D.SalesOrderDetailID, 
	O.ProductID, 
	O.SpecialOfferID, 
	O.ModifiedDate 
FROM 
	Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
	INNER JOIN 
	Sales.SpecialOfferProduct AS O 
	ON 
		D.SpecialOfferID=O.SpecialOfferID 
		AND 
		D.ProductID=O.ProductID;
```

## Indexes
- everytime we create a key or a unique column we place an index on the column
- indexes are stored separately from the data but accessed automatically when we run a query
- and are updated everytime a row is added or removed from the table
- index is a data structure to help DB look up information fast, usually a balanced tree on data that can be ordered and searched using the equality operators `<,>,<=,>=,==,` and `between`
- its created automatically but we can create it with create index command
- instead of Btrees there are other generalized types of indexes as well
an index based on a column or multiple columns or drop an index
```postgreSQL
CREATE INDEX transaction_id ON transaction(name);
DROP INDEX transaction_ikd;
CREATE INDEX transaction_id_2 ON transaction(name,payment_type);
```
### kinds of indexes
1. clustered
	1. stores and organizes the table
	2. arrange the data in the table like sort to make look up faster
	3. a table can have only one clustered index thats because its just the entire table sorted on the cluster key
	4. when we add new rows old rows dont have to move for them to stay in order because the new row will be added into the correct data page which will have some free space
2. non-clustered
	1. defined on one or more columns of the table, its a separate structure that points to the actual table
	2. stores the data and records in different tables so that scanning records is faster to look for the data you want

indexes are optional but greatly improve performance when properly designed and implemented

but they can also take up disk space

If a table has four nonclustered indexes, every write to that table may require four additional writes to keep the indexes up to date
##### example
- phone directory, primary key is the phone number but the cluster key is the first name plus the last name
- if the name starts with d you start looking in the beginning of the directory in your brain you did this calculation
    - mid alphabet is j or k and d<j or k so it must be in the first half, thats basically a binary search
