Why you think they'd be great for Visa:


As someone passionate about building scalable systems, I'm drawn to the opportunity to work on payment infrastructure that processes billions of transactions worldwide and affects people's daily lives.
With my BTech in Computer Science and 2 years of experience as a Software Engineer at Incedo, I bring the exact technical skills required for this role. I have expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate and SQL databases. What sets me apart is my comprehensive DevOps background. I've implemented CI/CD pipelines and have hands on experience with Docker, Kubernetes and Azure Cloud Services. I've held up code quality and set coding standards by integrating SonarQube scanning in build processes and security practices by making containers CrowdStrike compliant. 
I've worked with distributed systems and microservice architectures that include cloud services, and my AZ-204 certification can vouch for it. I excel at collaborating across teams in Agile environments and bring a growth mindset and genuine curiosity about emerging technologies.

– Utilized Spring Boot, Azure cloud services, Azure DevOps, and Docker for application development, pipeline
management, build configuration, and containerization.
– Applied Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and CQRS pattern in microservices architecture, implementing
bounded contexts and event-driven communication between domains.
– Implemented outbox pattern with Spring Boot, Kafka and PostgreSQL to provide transactional consistency across
distributed systems.
– Integrated security measures such as authentication and authorization using Spring Security, ensuring secure API
endpoints and data protection.
– Engineered new microservice endpoints, extending the File Management System, and serverless functions to
processing documents and inject them it into Azure Data Factory.
– Orchestrated distributed load testing infrastructure on Kubernetes, enabling QA teams to execute automated
K6-operator scripts via cron-jobs with Azure Files PVC integration.
– Architected automated database schema migration using migrate-mongo through ArgoCD pre-sync hooks in Helm
charts, ensuring consistent database schema deployments across environments.
– Automated SSRS report CI/CD process to Power BI Report Server via Azure Pipelines and integrated sparse checkout
of mono-repos to provide an improvement in build time of 95.67% (5 min to 16 sec).
– Implemented SonarQube code analysis in Pull Request workflows via Azure DevOps build pipelines, enforcing code
quality gates.
– Enhanced container security by implementing Crowdstrike compliance measures for Docker images and Kubernetes
pods, reducing security vulnerabilities from 80% to 10%(required).

– Mastered Spring Boot, Java, and React JS through intensive 1.5-month training.
– Developed a proof-of-concept project utilizing Spring Boot RESTful APIs and React.js.
– Spearheaded a team of 7 interns and led the daily stand-up calls to develop and implement new features using Clean
Architecture.
