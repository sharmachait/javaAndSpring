Circuit breaker - 
if api calls start failing the gateway server will immediately fail all future api calls to prevent delay.
it will allow slowly some leakage and if they work, it will allow all api calls further.
initially the application is in closed state - allows all traffic
if failure threshold is met we transition to open state - no api call is served, and we wait for 90 seconds(or per config) to serve some api calls
when we start to server some api calls thats called half_open state, if failure rate in half open is below threshold we go to close, if failure above threshold we go back to open state where no api call is served

controller is for MVC
