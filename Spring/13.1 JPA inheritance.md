Creating two tables in the DB by inheriting a single class in two entity classes using **`@MappedSuperClass`**
```java
@MappedSuperClass
public class Account {
	@Id
	private Long id;
	private String owner;
	private BigDecimal balance;
	private BigDecimal interestRate;
}
@Entity
public class DebitAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal overdraftFee;
}
@Entity
public class CreditAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal creditLimit;
}
```
this only shares the common fields between the two entities
doesnt provide JPA capabilities to the account class 
## Inheritance strategies
#### Single table
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
public class Account {
	@Id
	private Long id;
	private String owner;
	private BigDecimal balance;
	private BigDecimal interestRate;
}
@Entity
public class DebitAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal overdraftFee;
}
@Entity
public class CreditAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal creditLimit;
}
```

this creates a single table in the DB with both fields overdraftFee and creditLimit as nullables, the table will also have a column for the type of object the row is mapping to
```sql
CREATE TABLE account (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    dtype VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL,  -- Discriminator column
    owner VARCHAR(255),
    balance NUMERIC(19, 2),
    interest_rate NUMERIC(19, 2),
    overdraft_fee NUMERIC(19, 2),  -- DebitAccount field
    credit_limit NUMERIC(19, 2),   -- CreditAccount field
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

while inserting into it with raw Sql we will need mention the class name as the DType
```java
INSERT INTO Account (balance, interest_rate, owner, overdraft_fee, dtype, id ) 
VALUES (1000, 1.5, 'john doe', 25, 'DebitAccount', 1)
```

#### Joined Table
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Account {
	@Id
	private Long id;
	private String owner;
	private BigDecimal balance;
	private BigDecimal interestRate;
}
@Entity
public class DebitAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal overdraftFee;
}
@Entity
public class CreditAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal creditLimit;
}
```

this creates 3 tables in the database, 1 for each class and a one to one relationship is created between the parent table and the child tables
the child table will only have the fields unique to them specified in their respective classes
and therefor we will need to use joins when querying from them with raw sql

#### Table per class
```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public class Account {
	@Id
	private Long id;
	private String owner;
	private BigDecimal balance;
	private BigDecimal interestRate;
}
@Entity
public class DebitAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal overdraftFee;
}
@Entity
public class CreditAccount extends Account {
	private BigDecimal creditLimit;
}
```

in this case there will be three tables as well
but the child tables will also have all the properties from the parent class in them
we might need to do unions to get all the data

## Demerits to Inheritance

Concepts of one paradigm leak into another
ids and primary keys would not be required in one but required in another
requires joins and union alls which can be slow
