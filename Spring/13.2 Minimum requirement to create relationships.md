## ManyToOne
```java
public class Many {
	@ManyToOne
	@JoinColumn(nullable=false,unique=true,updatable=false)
	private One one;
}

public class One {
	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "one", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE})
	private Set<Many> many;
}
```

in the above example the many class it the owner of the relationship, its the one that will have the foreign key, as it doesnt have the mapped by
in the hash code implementation we should remove the nested entities by not using the set when generating hashcode
the join column annotation can be used to specify properties about the foreign key like **nullable**, **unique**, **insertable**, **updateable**
the referencedColumnName property is used to specify the reference column of the FK constraint, defaults to the primary key of the other table
## ManyToMany
```java
public class Student {
    @ManyToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE})
    @JoinTable(name = "student_subject",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "subject_id"))
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

public class Subject {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "subjects") // No cascade here
    private Set<Student> students;
}
```

### Json Back reference
this setup for both will cause infinite loop during serialization
can be avoided in two ways
1. JsonIgnore
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

public class Student {
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name="student_subject",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "subject_id"))
    @JsonIgnore
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}
```
1. Manage the json back reference
- `@JsonManagedReference` is placed on the _owning side_ (the one with `@JoinTable`). this entity will be serialized completely including the relationship
- `@JsonBackReference` is placed on the _inverse side_ (the one mapped by the owning entity). this will not have the relationship when serialized
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonManagedReference;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonBackReference;

public class Student {
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name="student_subject",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "subject_id"))
    @JsonManagedReference
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

public class Subject {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "subjects", cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
    @JsonBackReference
    private Set<Student> students;
}
```

## OneToOne
```java
public class SchoolClass {
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "schoolClass", cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
	@JsonBackReference
	private Teacher teacher;
}
public class Teacher {
	@OneToOne
	@JoinColumn(nullable=false,unique=true,updatable=false)
	@JsonManagedReference
	private SchoolClass schoolClass;
}
```

## On delete cascade (sql)
in any of these relationships we will not be able to delete a row from the owner relationship as long as it has a valid foreign key into another table, so we need to first delete the entry in the non-owning table and then delete in the owning table, in order and in a transaction

or 

we can also give cascade type of delete in the jpa entity

```java
public class Many {
	@ManyToOne
	@JoinColumn(nullable=false,unique=true,updatable=false)
	private One one;
}

public class One {
	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "one", cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REMOVE})
	private Set<Many> many;
}
```
but we should be very careful with this

### **Difference Between `orphanRemoval = true` and `cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE`**

|Feature|`orphanRemoval = true`| `CascadeType.REMOVE` |
|---|---|---|
|Deletes child when removed from collection|✅| ❌                    |
|Deletes child when parent is deleted|✅| ✅                    
**orphan removal does not work for `@ManyToMany` relationships** because the child entity is usually shared between multiple parents

## N + 1 problem
when working with lazy fetch if we are planning to loop over the Collection and get all the properties from the database any ways, tis better to do an eager fetch, otherwise it will run a query against the database for every iteration

if we ever find our selves doing something like this

```java
someRepository.findAllByCustomerId(id).stream()
	.map(object -> object.getNestedEntity().stream()
		.collect(do some operation)
	);
```
in this code the nested entity should be fetched eagerly and not lazily

but eager is not always better because it may cause over fetching data in other cases 

better solved with **fetch mode subselect**
```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)
    private Set<Employee> employees;
}
```
- The first query fetches the parent entities
- A single subsequent query (using a subselect) fetches all related entities for all parents at once
- Reduces the N+1 problem to exactly 2 queries (regardless of the number of parent entities)
- Works well for larger collections where batching might hit limits
- Doesn't cause Cartesian product issues like EAGER fetching with joins
- Avoids potential memory issues with large JOIN FETCH result sets
