# unidirectional one to one
1. create a field of the Model we want the relationship with
```java
@data
@Entity
public class Person {

	@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.Eager, cascade=CascadeType.ALL, targetEntity = Address.class)
	@JoinColumn(name = "address_id", referencedColumnName = "addressId", nullable = true)
	private Address address;
}
```
in the joincolumn annotation 
the name is the name of the column in the Person table in the database and the 
referencedColumnName is the name of the field in the target Entity Class
the targetEntity is an optional as we have already defined the target entity in the field data type
FetchType defines that whenever the Person is fetched from the database then the Address will be fetched along with it
the other possible type is LAZY, it will only fetch data from database when we do person.getAddress()

by default \*ToMany are lazy - because too many to fetch the query will be slowed
and all \*ToOne are eager

we have 6 casecade types they allow us to configure how the change to the parent table shoudl propagate down to child table
1. ALL
2. DETACH - when a parent is detached from the db context detach the child as well
3. REMOVE - dont use in scenario like User - Role because when we delete the user role will also be deleted
4. REFRESH - child also gets reloaded from database when parent is reloaded
5. MERGE - when two parents are merged merge the children as well
6. PERSIST - save() persists down to child
#### to omit a field from json serialization and desirailization
use @JsonIgnore on top of that field
```java
@Data  
@Entity  
public class Category {  
  @Id  
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)  
  private Long id;  
  private String name;  
  
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "category")  
  @JsonIgnore  
  private List<Product> products;  
}
```
