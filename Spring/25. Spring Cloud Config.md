Benefit 1 - can update the values without requiring restart of applications
Benefit 2 - supports encryption
Benefit 2 - Central hub for configuration management
All our applications can subscribe to the centralized config server as clients and get configurations from it during startup
we can configure a data store to store all the configurations, like a database, or a git repo
the server loads the configuration properties and sees the distribution of the configuration to multiple applications

### Auto refresh configuration

step 0  target applications should have actuator endpoints
step 1 in my target application application.yml, expose actuator refresh endpoint

```yml
management:  
  endpoints:  
    web:  
      exposure:  
        include: "*"
```
adding this to my target application yaml configuration will expose actuator endpoints that can refresh my application state, then when ever my files in the github repo change we can call this refresh endpoint to refresh my application

but this will not change the startup port off the application or invalidate the db connection as their objects were created / their value was used at the time of startup

the api to refresh configuration looks like so
http post on
`http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh`
https://github.com/sharmachait/spring-boot-microservices/pull/2/files
but this still requires us to manually hit this api for each of the microservice this problem can be solved with spring cloud bus
