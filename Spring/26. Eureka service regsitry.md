when microservice startup they must register their addresses at a central repo
the central server expects a health check from all these services, and deregister them if they dont respond
microservices should de register themselves when they go down

we need eureka server and actuator as dependency

When we use fiegn client we only have to define our client declaratively
spring boot generates it for us

when working with eureka server it does the dns resolution with the eureka server on its own
