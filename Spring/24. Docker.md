To make jars of our application ,in the pom.xml we need to mention packaging as jar after artifactId

```xml
    <artifactId>accounts</artifactId>  
    <packaging>jar</packaging>  
```

```Dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:23-jdk-alpine AS build  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . .  
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests  
  
FROM eclipse-temurin:23-jre-alpine  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar  
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
