also has master slave architecture
master listens to the clients and spins up containers on workers
these managed containers, managed by the master instance is called a pod
we can have multiple containers in a single pod
whats the point of pods?
containers in the same pod can share teh file system

api server is the daemon that listens for kube commands
etcd is a distributed in memory cache
	multiple masters can share data in the etcd
when an api server gets a command to start a pod it puts that info in etcd, basically the end state
then the kube-controller-manager and the kube-scheduler read that information calculate the diff that needs to be perform spins up the pods for us
scheduler runs in an infinite loop and assigns workers to the the pod info stored in the etcd
the controller manager manages
- deployment controller
- jobs controller
- replica set controller

the container runtime is the allocated os resources where the containers run
kubelet is another daemon that keeps on running and spins up containers in the container runtime
kube-proxy is the reverse proxy manager, to redirect http requests to the correct containers
