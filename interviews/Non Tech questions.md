**Sonar docker pipeline no comments "Yes, I have missed a deadline once. Early in my career, I underestimated the time required for a project because I didn’t account for some unexpected technical challenges. As soon as I realized I might not make the deadline, I immediately informed my manager and the team, explained the situation, and proposed a revised timeline. I also prioritized my tasks and worked overtime to minimize the delay. In the end, the project was only a day late, and my manager appreciated my transparency and proactive communication. Since then, I’ve become much better at estimating timelines and always build in a buffer for unexpected issues."**
