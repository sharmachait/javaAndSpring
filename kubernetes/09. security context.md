the root user inside a container is not the same as the root user in the host
it has different capabilities defined for it
if we run a container with the --privileged flag then it has all capabilities

the same settings can be done in Kubernetes as well
either at container level or the pod level, if done at pod level all the containers have the same settings in that pod

Pod level configuration
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
spec: 
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 # user id
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```

container level configuration
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
spec: 
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      securityContext:
	    runAsUser: 1000 # user id
	    capabilities:
	      add: ["MAC_ADMIN"]
```

if we define the security context at both the levels the container level is given priority
we can define the capabilities at the container level

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 0
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu
    image: ubuntu
    command:
    - sleep
    - "4800"
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["SYS_TIME"]
```

### privileged mode
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privileged-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
```

not the same as root user
runAsUser: 0 is the root user
