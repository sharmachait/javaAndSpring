by default all pods in the same namespace can talk to each other using the pods ip address or the pod name or the service 
all objects can communicate to each other as they are all part of the same virtual network
to prevent the pod hosting the frontend to communicate with the pod hosting the DB we can setup network policies

for the POD we can setup a rule to allow traffic only from the API pod on port 3306
1. we need to create a network policy with this rule defined
2. link the Network policy to the pod using labels and selectors

to deny all ingress to a pods
> kubectl create networkpolicy default-deny-ingress --namespace=myns --ptype=ingres

"allow type of traffic(ingress/egress) to pod(selector) on port with protocol"
```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec: 
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
```

to be able to define Egress rules defined Egress in the policy types

when deciding which rule you need think of where the original request originates and goes to
this rule does not mean that the db pod will be able to make api calls to the api pod
the origin must be the api pod, the db pod can only send responses to the api pod from the same port

the above policy allows all the pods from all namespaces to connect to this database, but we only want the prod namespace to be able to connect to this database, to do this, along with the podselector property we can also define the namespace selector
the namespace also needs to have the label defined on it

the ports field are used for DNS resolution on TCP and UDP

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec: 
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
      namespaceSelector: 
        matchLabels:
          name: prod
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
```

if we have an application not on the cluster but a third party we can define network policies for such third party services as well using their IP addresses
```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec: 
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - ipBlock: 
        cidr: 192.168.5.10/32
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
```

we can define both ipBlock and podselector together and work together in a logical OR format
```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec: 
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - ipBlock: 
        cidr: 192.168.5.10/32
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
      namespaceSelector: 
        matchLabels:
          name: prod
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
```

the pod selector and the namespace selector both work together in a logical AND format
if we define a dash (-) infront of namespaceSelector then both will be ORed
```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec: 
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from: 
    - ipBlock: 
        cidr: 192.168.5.10/32
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
    - namespaceSelector: 
        matchLabels:
          name: prod
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      protocol: TCP
```

in ingress we define the from object in Egress we define the to object
