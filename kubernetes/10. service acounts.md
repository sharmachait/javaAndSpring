To create a service account
>kubectl create serviceaccount accountname

To get the service accounts
>kubectl get serivceaccount

when we create a service account it also creates a token for us, that must be used by external applications to authenticate, we can see the details about the service account with,
>kubectl describe serviceaccount accountname

the token is actually a secret object and its name can be seen when we describe the account
we can see the token value with 
>kubectl describe secret secret-token-name

we can set a service account for a deployment with
> `kubectl set serviceaccount deploy app-d <serviceaccount-name>`

the token can be used as a bearer token, when making api calls to the kubernetes api
in case the application that needs to make the api calls to the kubernetes api is running on the cluster itself, authentication can be made easier by simply mounting the token secret into the container that is running the application

every namespace has a default service account
when ever a pod is created the default service accounts token is mounted automatically by the application onto the Pod
we dont even need to define the volume mount to be able to use it

so if we were to inspect a pod with `kubectl describe pod pod-name` we can see a volume mount onto the secret token of the default account

the token is available at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount` as 3 different files
1. ca.crt
2. namespace
3. token
we can cat the token file to see the token

the default service account is very restricted and only has access to basic kubernetes apis

if we want to use a different service account that you created then we can specify that in the manifest
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
	name: app
spec:
	containers:
		- name: app
		  image: image-name
	serviceAccountName: accountname
```

we cannot edit the service account for a pod we must delete it first but we can edit the service account in case of a deployment 

we can make kubernetes not mount the secret of the default service account with automountServiceAccountToken: false
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
	name: app
spec:
	containers:
		- name: app
		  image: image-name
	automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

but this has scalability issue as each account needs to have a secret associated with it and also each new namespace has a service account and a secret
a new way to authenticate was introduced, by requesting for tokens via an api

version 1.22 onwards the secret of the default service account is longer used when ever a pod is created, instead a token with a defined lifetime is generated though the token api
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
          name: kube-api-token
          readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: kube-api-token
      projected:
        defaultMode: 420
        sources:
          - serviceAccountToken:
              expirationSeconds: 3607
              path: token
```

with version 1.24
when ever we create a service account it no longer automatically creates a secret with the auth token
token needs to be generated with 
>kubectl create serviceaccount accountname
>kubectl create token accountname

this token will then be printed and has an expiry date defined
but if we still want to create service accounts with non expiring tokens in secrets, can be achieved via
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
metadata:
  name: mysecretname
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: accountname
```
but is not the recommended way

in a deployment the service account can be specified at `spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName`
