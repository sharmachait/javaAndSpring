 Its a package manager for whats installed and running on our cluster
its apk but for a cluster
allows installing updating and rolling back applications from kubernetes

Charts are just Manifest bundles tokenized(templating) with dynamic values for different environments

A running instance of a chart (loaded with a specific set of config values) is called a release, managed by helm allowing us to install update and rollback
### helm commands

to manage repositories and list helm packages
> **`helm repo [add, index, list, remove, update]`**

install/uninstall a helm chart
> **`helm install [folder path / repo+package] -<options to specify value files>`**

to describe instllations, revisions, status etc
> **`helm status <release>`**

to list helm releases in your environment
> helm list --all-namespaces
> **`helm uninstall <release> --keep-history`**
> helm upgrade
> helm rollback
> helm package

pakcage is used to deploy the helm chart to a repo

#### helm templating
instead of hard coding the values in the manifest file, we can write them in a values.yaml file and tokenize the manifest file to reference the values

when we use helm install command we can specify to use one of the three values file

### creating helm charts

> helm create k6-operator

in the chart.yaml we only need to care about the name and the version

> helm install k6-operator k6-operator/ --values k6-operator/values.yaml

we can define multiple value files, the second one over rides values from the first
>helm install k6-operator k6-operator/ --values k6-operator/values.yaml -f k6-operator/values-dev.yaml -n dev


loki storing in local filesystem

find storage here


connect loki to grafana  (we dont even need to just go to home>explore and start querying)

to make sure an instance of promtail is deployed on each node a daemonset is used 



### diagram
draw a kubernetes cluster with multiple nodes,
the nodes should have an app pod deployed on them and all will have a promtail pod as well, deployed as part of a daemon set
the promtail pod will be stream the logs to a loki pod that is running on only one of the nodes
also draw a grafana instance outside the cluster, the grafana will be connenting to the loki pod to crete dashboards
show the promtail pod reading logs from `/var/log/containers/**.log`
the `/var/log/container/**.log` is on every node, not outside the cluster
yes but write the read location as well, the location is /var/log/containers
show the grafana instace hitting the loki pod on http://loki:3100/metrics
