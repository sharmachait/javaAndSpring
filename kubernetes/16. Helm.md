Its a package manager for whats installed and running on our cluster
its apk but for a cluster
allows installing updating and rolling back applications from kubernetes

Charts are just Manifest bundles tokenized(templating) with dynamic values for different environments

A running instance of a chart (loaded with a specific set of config values) is called a release, managed by helm allowing us to install update and rollback
### helm commands

to manage repositories and list helm packages
> **`helm repo [add, index, list, remove, update]`**

install/uninstall a helm chart
> **`helm install [folder path / repo+package] -<options to specify value files>`**

to describe instllations, revisions, status etc
> **`helm status <release>`**

to list helm releases in your environment
> helm list --all-namespaces
> **`helm uninstall <release> --keep-history`**
> helm upgrade
> helm rollback
> helm package

pakcage is used to deploy the helm chart to a repo

#### helm templating
instead of harcoding the values in the manifest file, we can write them in a values.yaml file and tokenize the manifest file to reference the values

when we use helm install command we can specify to use one of the three values file

### creating helm charts

> helm create k6-operator

in the chart.yaml we only need to care about the name and the version

> helm install k6-operator k6-operator/ --values k6-operator/values.yaml

we can define multiple value files, the second one over rides values from the first
>helm install k6-operator k6-operator/ --values k6-operator/values.yaml -f k6-operator/values-dev.yaml -n dev
