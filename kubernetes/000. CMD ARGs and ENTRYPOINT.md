## Docker Cmd vs Entrypoint
when we run a container we can provide the startup command as arguments as well

```
docker run ubuntu sleep 5
```

this makes the container sleep for 5 second when it starts up

this is equivalent to ending the docker file with a CMD that makes it sleep for 5 seconds

```
FROM Ubuntu
CMD ["sleep", "5"]
```

if we provide the startup command at runtime it will overwrite the entrypoint command

```
docker run my-ubuntu sleep 10
```

this will make the above image sleep for 10 seconds at startup

cmd makes a command run at startup but if i want a program to run at startup and provide run time argument to that program it can be done via ENRTYPOINT

```
FROM Ubuntu
# BUILD THE REDIS SERVER
ENTRYPOINT ["my-redis"]
```

this image runs the my-redis software to which we can provide run time arguments like so

```
docker run redis master
docker run redis slave
```

here master and slave are run time arguments being provided to the my-redis program

the command line parameters are appended to the command in case of entrypoint so the command at start up becomes

```
my-redis master
my-redis slave
```

if we want to have some default parameters at run time for the program being startup it can be done so with a combination of entrypoint and cmd

```
FROM Ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["5"]
```

if we run this image with

```
docker run my-ubuntu 10
```

then the 10 will overwrite the 5 in the cmd as a parameter to the sleep entrypoint

if we dont provide a parameter then the 5 will be used as a default parameter to the entrypoint

If you have multiple CMD instructions:
- Only the LAST CMD will take effect
- Previous CMD instructions are ignored

## Kubernetes Commands Entrypoint and Arguments

the docker run command takes run time arguments that server as the startup command or the parameters to the entrypoint defined in the docker file
equivalent can be defined in the manifest file container spec

> docker run --name ubuntu sleeper ubuntu-sleeper 10

its equivalent in manifest would be
pod.yml
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu-sleeper
      args: ["10"]
```

if we wanted to run the ubuntu image and make it sleep for 5 seconds
> docker run ubuntu sleep 5
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu
      args: ["sleep", "5"]
```

consider the docker file
```Dockerfile
FROM Ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["5"]
```
in docker we can overwrite the entrypoint with --entrypoint flag
> docker run --entrypoint overwritten-sleep ubuntu-sleeper 10

the equivalent in kubernetes is done via the command option in the container spec
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubunut-sleeper
      command: ["overwritten-sleep"]
      args: ["10"]
```

the command overwrites the entrypoint and the args overwrite the cmd
