### vim
1. dd to delete
2. 3yy to copy three lines
3. p to paster
4. u to undo after dd
### tips
1. setting contexts will be required for almost every question
> kubectl config set-context cluster-name --namespace=myns
2. alias k=kubectl
3. k get pod -A for all namespaces
4. k config set-context context@cluster --namespace=default 
5. k config set-context --current --namespace=default 
6. k explain cronjob.spec.jobTemplate --recursive
7. export ns=default     
	1. useful when namespace is not a friendly name
8. alias k='kubectl -n $ns'
9. alias kdr= 'kubectl -n $ns -o yaml --dry-run'
10. Before you attempt a new question, be sure to execute command to switch contexts. It is given at the start of the question
11. Sometimes you need to ssh to another node or change to root user. Beware of where you are all the time on bash terminal.
## Bash

passing command to sh with -c 
```yml
  - command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - echo Initialize application environment! && sleep 10
```
or

```yml
  - command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - echo 'Initialize application environment!' && sleep 10
```

Start a script file with a shebang
```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

to check the current user
> whoami

to give a file executable permissions
> chmod +x filename.sh

to create variables
> name=chaitanya

to access it
>$name

we can read user input into a variable with
```bash
echo what is you first name
read firstname
```

we can accept positional arguments with
```sh
echo hello $1 $2
```
and we can pass variables to this .sh file by simply providing values when invoking it
> ./arg.sh chaitanya sharma

$0 stores the name of the command invoked


to write to a file use > it will overwrite the content in the file
to append to a file use >>

to input get the text from a file 
> echo < hello.txt

for to provide direct strings to a command
>echo <<< "some string"

to get the exit code of the last executed command
>echo $?

we can use this with the test syntax to check equality
`[ hello = hello ]`
this in it self wont return anything but will produce exit code 0 as they are equal 
the exit code can be peeped at with echo $?

for numerical values use -eq instead of =

#### if else
```sh
if [${1,,} = herbert]; then
	echo "type shit"
elif [${1,,} = help]; then
	echo "baby i am preying on you tonight"
else
	echo "awoooooo"
fi
```

the two commas make shell ignore cases upper or lower

when using < or > wrap in double square brackets
```sh
word=a
if [[ $word < "b" ]] then
	echo "true"
fi
```

to check if a file exists or not

```sh
read filename
if [ -e $filename ] then
	echo "$filename exists"
```

### arithematics

```sh
a=1
b=2

echo $(( a + b ))
echo $( expr $a - $b ) # with expr * neeeds to be escaped with "\*"
# / * % 
# for decimal
bc "20.5+5"
bc "$a+$b"
# for division of decimals we need to specify precision
bc "scale=2;20.5/5"
# to do things like sqrt
bc -l "scale=2;sqrt(2)"
bc -l "scale=2;3^3"
```

### arrays

```sh
os=("ubuntu" "kali")

echo "${os[@]}" # prints all
echo "${os[0]}" # prints first
echo "${#os[@]}" # prints length

os[2] = "uwuntu" # adds an element to the list

unset os[2] # removes the second element
```

### loops
```sh
n=1
while [$n -le 10]
do
	echo "$n"
	n=$((n+1))
done

cat hello.sh | while read line
do
	echo $p
done

for var in {1..7}
do

done

for (( i=0; i<5; i++))
do

done
```

### functions
```sh
function name(){
	echo "chaitanya"
}
name # to invoke it

function name(){
	echo $1
}
name "chaitanya"
```
