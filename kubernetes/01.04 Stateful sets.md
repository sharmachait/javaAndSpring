used for things like database pods, in a multi pod setup for high availability
we also need the data to be consistent across pods

the simple way to do is to setup one as master node, where all the writes happen and the other pods serve as read only replicas
the data base software allows us to sync the data across nodes via built in features

what we can do is setup the master node first then setup slaves and have them clone from master

but with deployments we cant guarantee this order that the master should come up first then the slaves

the master also needs to have a constant host name that doesnt change so the clones are able to replicate data from it continuously 

stateful sets can help us do that

stateful sets are almost the same as deployments, except

1. with stateful sets pods are created in a sequential order
2. each pod is assigned a unique id starting from 0
3. each pods gets a unique name derived from their id, podname-0, podname-1 and so on
	1. since the names are no longer random we can rely on these names to direct the slave nodes to talk to the master
	2. if the pod crashes it is brought up with the same name, pod names serve as domains
StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

- Stable, unique network identifiers.
- Stable, persistent storage.
- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
- Ordered, automated rolling updates.
### Creating a stateful set

almost the same as creating a deployment
1. only the kind is different
2. it also requires a **serviceName** - to make a pod to talk to another pod we need a service, but we dont want the writes to be load balanced to the slaves
	1. thats where headless services help us, its a service that doesnt load balance requests, headless services give us dns entries to reach each pod individually
		1. a headless service doesnt have an ip of its own 
		2. it only creates dns entries for pods using the pods name
		3. the dns entry looks like **podname.headless-servicename.namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example**
3. before deploying a stateful set we should deploy the headless service first

when a headless service is created a dns entry is created for a pod only if 
1. for the pod **spec.subdomain** should be set to the **metadata.name** of the headless service
2. **spec.hostname** should be defined for the pod
if we are using an abstraction like stateful set then we dont need to but **if we are creating pods directly then we need to** as in case of statefulsets the pod name with the id is used as the hostname and the serviceName is used as the subdomain

if we were able to specify subdomain and hostname in the manifest of a deployment or a stateful set each and every pod would get the same hostname and that would cause dns conflicts

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-h
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None
  ports: 
  - port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec: 
  replicas: 3
  serviceName: mysql-h
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      app: mysql
  template: 
    metadata: 
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql
```

each pod gets a DNS record

we can scale up a stateful set with

>kubectl scale statefulset mysql --replcas=5

when we scale down the last pod is destroyed first then the second last
same goes with deleting a statefulset

to make this process and the process of creating pods to not follow a sequential order set **spec.podManagementPolicy: Parallel**
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec: 
  podManagementPolicy: Parallel
  replicas: 3
  serviceName: mysql-h
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      app: mysql
  template: 
    metadata: 
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql
```
