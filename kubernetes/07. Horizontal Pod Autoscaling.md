Updating the manifest and reapplying isnt actually auto scaling, we want to observer and monitor some metrics and based on that auto scale the pods
HPA basically controls the Replicas number in the deployment manifest

HPA is implemented as an intermittent loop that runs every 15 seconds

if we  run cadvisor locally it will start monitoring the metrics of our local containers
we need to add the cadvisor and the metrics server to our clusters, cadvisor monitors the pods and stores the data the metrics server serves the metrics to the master node api server via the kubernetes api

- cadvisor - [https://github.com/google/cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)
- Metrics server - 
>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

the default yaml file needs to be configured for our projects
a good example (Ref - [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/issues/237](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/issues/237))
>Apply from here - https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-28-manifests

applying this manifests start few pods in the kube-system namespace

we can then get the metrics with
>kubectl top pod
>kubectl top nodes

all of this setup is just to expose metrics and not autoscale based on that

to autoscale the pods we need a service to the Pod and an auto-scaler
