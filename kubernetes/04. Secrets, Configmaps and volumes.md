## differences
#### secrets
stored in base 64 encoded format, allows data to be transmitted in manifest files
changed and updated frequently as keys need to be rotated
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata: 
	name: example-secret
type: Opaque
data:
	password: sjhfgu34mqb];da?
	apiKey: kjhydofb9834r
```
secrets provide integration with external services like key vault
when we describe a secret it doesnt show the values
but it will show them if we extract its manifest into a yaml with
>kubectl get secret app-secrets -o yaml 

secrets are not actually safe

use a key vault instead or enable encryption at rest for them [Encrypting secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)
- A secret is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it.
- kubelet doesnt store the secret in disk storage
- when pod is deleted secret is deleted from the worker node as well
- secrets have types, used for different use cases
kubernetes.io/service-account-token is used to store jwt tokens for authentication between pods
This type of Secret is **automatically created** by Kubernetes when a service account is created (if the service account is not configured to disable token automation). These tokens are mounted into pods that are bound to the service account, enabling the pod to authenticate with the Kubernetes API.
**Automatic Mounting into Pods**:
- When a pod specifies a `serviceAccountName`, Kubernetes automatically injects this Secret into the pod at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/`.
#### configmaps
stores data in simple text format
values dont change very often
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata: 
	name: example-config
data:
	key1: value1
	key2: value2
```
stored in etcd
we can view the data stored in the config map with
> kubectl describe configmap nameOfTheConfigMap

#### strategy 1 to use with deployments
to read config map values as env variables
create a config map for the each container that is being deployed, and refer to the config map in the deployment manifest of the application 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myapp-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://mydb.example.com"
  LOGGING_LEVEL: "INFO"
  APP_ENVIRONMENT: "production"

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myapp-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  DB_PASSWORD: "mysecretpassword"
  API_KEY: "secretapikey"

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
	matchLabels:
	  app: myapp
  template:
    metadata: 
      labels: 
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:latest
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: myapp-config
        - secretRef:
            name: myapp-secrets
```
or
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
	matchLabels:
	  app: myapp
  template:
    metadata: 
      labels: 
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:latest
        env:
	    - name: DATABASE_URL
		  valueFrom:
		    configMapKeyRef:
			  name: myapp-config
			  key: DATABASE_URL
		- name: API_KEY
		  valueFrom:
		    secretKeyRef:
			  name: myapp-secrets
			  key: API_KEY
```
#### strategy 2 to use with deployments
reading config maps as file mounts
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myapp-config
data:
  application.properties: |
	app.name=backend
	app.env=production
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: myapp-config
      containers:
      - name: myapp-container
        image: nginx:latest  # Replace with your actual application image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
```
the config file will be mounted at /etc/config inside my container
![[Pasted image 20241207230228.png]]
```java
FileReader reader = new FileReader("/etc/config/application.properties");
Properties props = new Properties();
props.load(reader);
String appName = props.getProperty("app.name");
// This would return "backend"
```

## Encrypting secrets at rest

so when we create a secret the data is stored in the etcd server
we can check the etcd store with 
>kubectl create secret generic secret1 -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
>apt-get etcd-client
```shell
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl \
   --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt   \
   --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
   --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key  \
   get /registry/secrets/default/secret1
```

we can check if encryption at rest is already enabled with
> ps -aux | grep kube-api | grep "encryption-provider-config"

this command greps for the option of encryption-provider-config in the kube-api process
if set encryption at rest is already enabled

to enable encryption at rest
```yml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - identity: {}
      - aesgcm:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
            - name: key2
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
            - name: key2
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
      - secretbox:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
```

the first provider in the list is used
if we really want to encrypt one of the others needs to be on the top like so

/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml
```yml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aesgcm:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
            - name: key2
              secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==
      - identity: {}
```
we need to save this and edit the kube-api server config to use this as the encryption provider
by adding the option of the provider
> vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

in the containner command section (entrypoint) add an option
> - --encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml

and since the file is created locally we need to mount it as well
the steps can be found at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/

after encryption is enabled the old secrets will not be encrypted


### reading a secret
we can read a secret using the following command

> kubectl get secret secret-name =o jsonpath="{.data.key-name}" | base64 --decode
