Its a package manager for whats installed and running on our cluster
its apk but for a cluster
allows installing updating and rolling back applications from kubernetes

Charts are just Manifest bundles tokenized(templating) with dynamic values for different environments

A running instance of a chart (loaded with a specific set of config values) is called a release, managed by helm allowing us to install update and rollback
### helm commands

to manage repositories and list helm packages
> **`helm repo [add, index, list, remove, update]`**

install/uninstall a helm chart
> **`helm install [folder path / repo+package] -<options to specify value files>`**

to describe installations, revisions, status etc
> **`helm status <release>`**

#### helm templating
instead of hard coding the values in the manifest file, we can write them in a values.yaml file and tokenize the manifest file to reference the values

when we use helm install command we can specify to use one of the three values file
