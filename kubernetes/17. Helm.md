Its a package manager for whats installed and running on our cluster
its apk but for a cluster
allows installing updating and rolling back applications from kubernetes

Charts are just Manifest bundles tokenized(templating) with dynamic values for different environments

A running instance of a chart (loaded with a specific set of config values) is called a release, managed by helm allowing us to install update and rollback

## Chart.yml
![[Pasted image 20250216010924.png]]
there are two types of charts
application and library

dependencies is where we define cross chart dependencies
### helm commands

to manage repositories and list helm packages
> **`helm repo [add, index, list, remove, update]`**

to search for charts
> helm search hub chart name # for artifact hub
> helm search repo chart name # for our added repos

install/uninstall a helm chart
> **`helm install release-name <chart>`**
> helm uninstall release-name
>helm install --values /path/to/values.yml my-release chart-name

to list the installed releases
>helm list

to describe installations, revisions, status etc
> helm history release-name

the above commands will give us revision numbers
we can roll back to a previous release with
> helm rollback release-name 1

1 will be the revision number we want to roll back to
helm creates a new revision which is essentially a copy of revision 1
#### helm templating
instead of hard coding the values in the manifest file, we can write them in a values.yaml file and tokenize the manifest file to reference the values
