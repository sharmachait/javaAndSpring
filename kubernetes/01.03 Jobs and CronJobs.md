### Jobs
Jobs used for some processing that are not long lived processes

if we create a Pod of base image alpine that does some maths as its entry command

it will exit but kubernetes will try to re run the pod again and again, because that is the nature of a pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: math-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: math
    image: alpine
    command: ["expr", "3", "+", "2"]
  restartPolicy: Always
```
the default restart policy is Always
can be changed to Never or OnFailure
we should use a job for such tasks
default restart policy of a Job is Never
and for cron job is OnFailure

```yml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata: 
  name: math-job
spec:
  backoffLimit: 4
  template: 
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: math-add
        image: ubuntu
        command: ["sh", "-c", "expr 3 + 2"]
```

backofflimit defines how many tries k8s will do incase of failure
activeDeadlineSeconds is used to make sure a cronjob completes within specified seconds or is terminated by k8s
no matter how many pods are created once the TTL of jobs is reached they are termincated

> kubectl get jobs

this job will have created a pod **math-job-sha**
> kubectl get pods

and since the job is completed successfully new pods will not be created
we wont see any restarts

the output of the above job can be seen with the logs command on the pod
> kubectl logs math-job-sha

deleting a job will also delete the pods that it created 

**a job is more like a replicaset, in that it manages pods**

to make the job run multiple pods use **spec.completions**

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata: 
  name: math-job
spec:
  completions: 3
  template: 
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: math-add
        image: ubuntu
        command: ["expr", "3", "+", "2"]
```

this will create 3 pods, sequentially one after the other

in case of the pods fails, the job will try to create new only until 3 successful completions 

to make the jobs be created in parallel use **spec.parallelism**

```yml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata: 
  name: math-job
spec:
  completions: 3
  parallelism: 3
  template: 
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: math-add
        image: ubuntu
        command: ["expr", "3", "+", "2"]
```

### CronJobs
basically jobs that can be scheduled 

**schedule: "/1 * * * * "**
where:
the first number is the minute can be 0-59
the second is hour can be 0-23
the third is day can be 1-31
the fourth is month can be 1-12
the fifth is day of the week 0-6 (sunday to saturday)


```yml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata: 
  name: math-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "/1 * * * *"
  jobTemplate: 
    spec: 
      completions: 3
      parallelism: 3
      template: 
        spec:       
          containers:
          - name: math-add
            image: ubuntu
            command: ["expr", "3", "+", "2"]
```

the cron job has 3 specs, one for the cronjob one for the job and one for the pod

### 1. **Create a Job**
```sh 
kubectl create job <job-name> --image=<image-name>
```

---
### 2. **Create a CronJob**
```sh 
kubectl create cronjob <cronjob-name> --image=<image-name> --schedule="<cron-schedule>"
```

```sh
kubectl create cronjob --image=kodekloud/throw-dice throw-dice-cron-job --schedule="30 21 * * *"
```
