Taint for a node is the repellant that keeps certain pods(that dont have the toleration for it) aways from it
Taints and tolerations are used to restrict which nodes certain pods should be run on

unless specified none of the pods can tolerate any taint

use-case
one of our nodes could have certain hardware required for certain kind of pods then we can apply a taint on that node and make the pods have a toleration for that taint

we can apply taints on nodes with

>`kubectl taint nodes node-name <key>=<value>:<effect>`

the effect can be equal to 
1. NoSchedule - pods that dont tolerate this taint can not be placed on this node
2. PreferNoSchedule - scheduler avoids placing here, but there are no hard rules, but does if needs to
3. NoExecute - Pods that dont tolerate this taint are killed if already running on this node + NoSchedule
	1. if a pod is evicted from a node due to a `NoExecute` taint, Kubernetes will attempt to schedule it on a different node
	2. there needs to be other nodes that the pods have toleration for and the nodes need to have required resources

> kubectl taint nodes node-1 app=blue:NoSchedule

to add toleration to a pod add it in its spec in the manifest
"app=blue:NoSchedule"
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    name: app
spec:
  containers: 
  - name: app
    image: app
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
  tolerations:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

tains and toleration are used to manage pods and telling what pods a certain node can accept

to manage pods and make then go to a certain node, that is done via node affinity

scheduler doesnt schedule any pods on the master node because it has a taint
we can see it via 
>kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint

we can remove a taint from a node with
>`kubectl taint nodes <node-name> spray=mortein:NoSchedule-`
>kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
