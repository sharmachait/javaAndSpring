Just because a node has a taint and a pod has a toleration for it, it doesnt guarantee that the pod will be run on that particular node exclusively, it still may be scheduled on another node that doesnt have a taint at all
taints are used to repel pods from nodes
to attract pods to certain nodes we have to use selectors and affinity
simply using selectors doesnt work because pods with no node selectors may be scheduled on nodes with labels

problem statement
we have a node with a label red and a node with no label at all, we have a pod(a) that needs to be scheduled only on the node with the red label and a pod(b) that needs to be scheduled on a node with no label at all
we essentially want to repel the pod(b) from the node with the red label using taints and allow the pod(a) to be scheduled on it with toleration, we also need to make sure pod(a) is scheduled only to the red node with node affinity
