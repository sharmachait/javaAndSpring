also has master slave architecture
master listens to the clients and spins up containers on workers
these managed containers, managed by the master instance is called a pod
we can have multiple containers in a single pod
whats the point of pods?
containers in the same pod can share teh file system

api server is the daemon that listens for kube commands
etcd is a distributed in memory cache
	multiple masters can share data in the etcd
when an api server gets a command to start a pod it puts that info in etcd, basically the end state
then the kube-controller-manager and the kube-scheduler read that information calculate the diff that needs to be perform spins up the pods for us
scheduler runs in an infinite loop and assigns workers to the the pod info stored in the etcd
the controller manager manages
- deployment controller
- jobs controller
- replica set controller

the container runtime is the allocated os resources where the containers run
kubelet is another daemon that keeps on running and spins up containers in the container runtime
kube-proxy is the reverse proxy manager, to redirect http requests to the correct containers

# KIND 

to create kubernetes cluster on your local machine
> curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.18.0/kind-linux-amd64
> chmod +x ./kind
> sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
> kind--version
> kind create cluster --name local

with this we will be able to create a master node on our machine, basically a container named local-control-plane
we can delete this cluster with
> kind delete cluster -n local

# multi node setup in kind
we can create a multi node setup with yml
```yml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

> kind create cluster --config clusters.yml --name local

now if we check the list of running containers we will see 3 and the control plane will have an api address and a port where we can hit the kubernetes api
why? because the master node has an api server inside it

how to tell the master node to create a pod on a worker node? using the kubernetes API
but it requires authentication
To authenticate its stored in .kube/config
> cat ~/.kube/config

when we use kubectl it tries to find the content of ~/.kube/config
reads the auth creds from there and uses the kubernetes api to send commands to the master node's api server

when we create an aks cluster we they will give us a config file that we need to put in this directory ~./kube from the machine we want to send kubectl commands to the master node
