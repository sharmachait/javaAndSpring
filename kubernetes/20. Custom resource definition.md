when we create a resource it is added to etcd
then the respective controller reads its config etcd
and creates the actual resource

to be able to define a custom resource, we need a custom resource controller that will read that resource from etcd and create the object / container for it
the code for that controller can be written in go or something

1. to be able to apply manifests for the custom resource we need to tell kubernetes that it should parse those manifests successfully 
2. can be done with CRD
```yml
apiVersion: apiextension.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata: 
  name: flighttickets.flights.com
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: flights.com
  names:
    kind: FlightTicket
    singular: flightticket
    plural: flighttickets
    shortNames:
    - ft
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties:
              from:
                type: string
              to:
                type: string
              number:
                type: integer
                minimum: 1
                maximum: 4
```

pod deployments are namspaced while PV and services are not
the singular and plural names are like pod and pods
shortNames are like rs for replicaset
served api version is served by the kube api server.
only one version can be the storage version
with this CRD created we will be able to apply this specific manifest and store data to etcd
```yml
apiVersion: flights.com/v1
kind: FlightTicket
metadata: 
  name: flightticket
spec:
  from: Mumbai
  to: London
  number: 2
```

but we also need a controller that can read that data from etcd and do something with it, run a job or create a container or something

the controller can run on our k8s cluster as a deployment
