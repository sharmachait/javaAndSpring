when we create a resource it is added to etcd
then the respective controller reads its config etcd
and creates the actual resource

to be able to define a custom resource, we need a custom resource controller that will read that resource from etcd and create the object / container for it
the code for that controller can be written in go or something

1. to be able to apply manifests for the custom resource we need to tell kubernetes that it should parse those manifests successfully 
2. can be done with CRD
```yml
apiVersion: apiextension.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata: 
  name: flighttickets.flights.com
spec:
  scope: Namespaced
  group: flights.com
  names:
    kind: FlightTicket
    singular: flightticket
    plural: flighttickets
    shortNames:
    - ft
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties:
              from:
                type: string
              to:
                type: string
              number:
                type: integer
                minimum: 1
                maximum: 4
```

pod deployments are namspaced while PV and services are not
the singular and plural names are like pod and pods
shortNames are like rs for replicaset
served api version is served by the kube api server.
only one version can be the storage version
with this CRD created we will be able to apply this specific manifest and store data to etcd
```yml
apiVersion: flights.com/v1
kind: FlightTicket
metadata: 
  name: flightticket
spec:
  from: Mumbai
  to: London
  number: 2
```

but we also need a controller that can read that data from etcd and do something with it, run a job or create a container or something

the controller can run on our k8s cluster as a deployment


### subresources

A subresource is a special endpoint that allows specific operations on a portion of the custom resource. It's like a subdivision of the main resource that has its own API endpoint and special behavior.

```yml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: foos.samplecontroller.k8s.io
  annotations:
    "api-approved.kubernetes.io": "unapproved, experimental-only"
spec:
  group: samplecontroller.k8s.io
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    kind: Foo
    plural: foos
  versions:
    - name: v1alpha1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        # schema used for validation
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              # Spec for schema goes here !
              type: object
              properties:
                deploymentName:
                  type: string
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                  minimum: 1
                  maximum: 5
            status:
              type: object
              properties:
                availableReplicas:
                  type: integer
      # subresources for the custom resource
      subresources:
        # enables the status subresource
        status: {}
```

In this specific example, the `status` subresource does two important things:

1. It creates a separate endpoint (`/status`) for updating the status of the custom resource
2. It splits the custom resource into two parts that can be updated independently:
    - The main spec (updated through the main endpoint)
    - The status (updated through the /status endpoint)
```sh
# Main resource endpoint
/apis/samplecontroller.k8s.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/foos/my-foo

# Status subresource endpoint
/apis/samplecontroller.k8s.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/foos/my-foo/status
```

In this CRD example, the status endpoint (`/status`) is specifically allowing you to update the `availableReplicas` field that was defined in the schema under the status section:
```yml
status:
  type: object
  properties:
    availableReplicas:
      type: integer
```

another option is to create a scale sub-resource instead of a status sub-resource
